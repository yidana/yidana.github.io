# GeoWeb Service for Ghana Statistical Service
Flexibility in census data storage, retrieval, display, availability and basic statistical analytic functionality is the main motivation behind this project, which seeks to develop a web service for handling census data. 
The mode of representation and distribution of census data influence the value of the data to individuals. Since the human brain is better at gathering or interpreting information as images or videos than in words or numbers, it is more productive to organize and present census data in a way that the human brain can easily understand. This established the motivation to develop a GeoWeb Service for handling census data. 
# What we achieved
The GeoWeb Service provides users with functionalities to obtain census data in a more interactive and efficient way. It combines tabular display of data with spatial and statistical display to provide a deeper meaning in data before acquisition.
# Functionalities
* Interactive choropleth maps showing the 2010 census data for districts and regional levels
* Data on maps can also be viewed in tables
* User can interact with data for each geographic region on the choropleth maps by obtaining data in tables or in charts (bar charts and pie charts)
* Tabular data can be downloaded as csv or pdf.
* Charts can also be downloaded as png or jpeg.
